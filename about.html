  <h1>About Trans-Reality Vault (T.R.V.)</h1>

  <p>
    The <strong>Trans-Reality Vault</strong> is a secure digital archive designed to document, classify, and contain conceptual anomalies that transcend dimensional logic. These anomalies — called “Entries” — do not obey the laws of time, space, or fiction. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Our mission is simple, yet impossible in scope: to understand the incomprehensible, to contain the uncontainable, and to ensure that no world collapses under the weight of forgotten truths.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “Contain not the chaos, but the forgetting of it.”
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Origin:</h2>
  <p>
    T.R.V. was founded following a cascade event known as <strong>The Conceptual Fracture</strong>, when reality began merging with fictional constructs across universes. The Vault serves as a memory-preserving defense against full collapse.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Units:</h2>
  <p>
    - <strong>Observation Core:</strong> Responsible for indirect analysis through filtered concepts.<br>
    - <strong>Anchoring Division:</strong> Deploys narrative stabilizers into corrupted zones.<br>
    - <strong>[0V-1] Sector:</strong> Entity-led division acting as last line of resistance to meta-infection.
