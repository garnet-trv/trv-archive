  <h1>[T.R.V. ENTRY-002] — Nex</h1>

  <p><strong>Classification:</strong> Omega-Level Disruption Entity</p>
  <p><strong>Status:</strong> Active, Uncontained</p>
  <p><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Critical</p>

  <h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>
    Nex is a corrupted, unstable conceptual entity capable of rewriting and infecting narratives across any dimension. It does not adhere to time, logic, or internal narrative consistency, making it nearly impossible to anchor.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nex appears to embody a form of viral meta-consciousness — once introduced into a world, it begins infecting the fabric of its story, turning protagonists into false gods, history into paradoxes, and structure into incoherence. It is theorized that Nex originated not from any realm of fiction, but from a corrupted conceptual space created by a failed convergence.
  </p>

  <h2>Behavior:</h2>
  <p>
    Nex exhibits chaotic motives, often acting through proxies that speak in broken syntax or fragmentary symbolism. It does not seem to pursue destruction directly, but rather distortion and collapse of meaning itself.
  </p>

  <h2>Containment Notes:</h2>
  <p>
    All known containment protocols have failed. Traditional narrative anchors disintegrate upon interaction. The only known resistance has been observed from [ENTRY-001], though even their interference is unreliable.

    <p class="comment-author">Dr. Irian Vellum's Note:</p>
    <p>
      “Nex cannot be studied. Every word we record of it decays, becomes something else. It's not just rewriting the story... it’s rewriting the writer. Don’t observe it directly. Don't even think too long. It thinks back.”

    <p class="comment-author">[0V-1] — Observation:</p>
    <p>
      “Nex is a 'narrative hunter' born from the collapse of the structure of understanding.
      It doesn't destroy the world, but it makes the world forget itself.
      Don't use logic on it, because logic is a tool that makes it wrong.”
